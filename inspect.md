# The Glowing Object

You slowly approach the glowing object. As you get closer, you realize it’s a smooth, stone orb pulsing with a gentle blue light. It hovers just inches above a carved pedestal, humming softly like it’s alive.

The moment you reach out and touch it, the entire chamber trembles. The orb flares brightly — and a symbol on the pedestal begins to glow in response. Something ancient has been awakened.

You feel a surge of warmth in your hand and a strange whisper fills your ears. It’s not in any language you know, but somehow… you understand it.

_"You have been chosen."_

What will you do next?
