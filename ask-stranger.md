# The Stranger's Identity

You narrow your eyes and ask, "Who are you?"

The stranger lowers their hood, revealing an older face marked by time and dust.  
"I was once a guardian of this temple," they say. "But now, I'm its prisoner.  
The artifact you saw—that orb—it holds the key to my freedom… and to your escape."

They look at you solemnly. "But taking it comes at a price."
