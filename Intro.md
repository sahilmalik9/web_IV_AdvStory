You lift your chin, eyes locked with the Watcher's glowing gaze. The weight of Eldoria presses on your shoulders, but deeper still lies your belief in something more enduring than strength or cunning—your heart.

“I choose the Trial of Spirit.”

A silence falls, heavier than stone. The Watcher closes its central eye. The room begins to blur and dissolve, and in an instant, you are no longer in the mountain chamber.

You’re standing in Wyrmwood Forest—but not as you last saw it. Trees are scorched. The earth is cracked and dry. Fires smolder in the distance. And there, amidst the destruction, lies the village where you were born—flattened.

You run forward, past the ruins, only to stop at a familiar sight: your childhood home, still intact… but surrounded by shadowy figures. From the dark steps forward a vision of yourself—but older, colder, eyes hollowed by power and loss.

This twisted version of you speaks:

“You failed. You tried to save them, but you weren’t strong enough. You should have taken the Trial of Strength. Or Wisdom. You were afraid.”

You draw your blade, trembling—not from fear, but heartbreak.

“No,” you whisper. “I chose spirit because I remember who I am. I don't need to beat monsters or solve puzzles to prove it.”

The shadow-you snarls and rushes forward—but as it nears, your courage hardens like steel. You do not flinch. You do not strike. You simply stand—and the vision shatters into light.

The world vanishes.

You wake on the stone floor of the chamber, gasping. The Watcher’s many eyes glow brighter than before.

"You faced what binds the soul. Few have passed the Trial of Spirit. Fewer still without raising a hand."

From a hidden alcove, the golem steps forward, carrying a crystal the size of your fist. It pulses with swirling light—the Crystal of Aether.

The Watcher speaks one final time:

“Take it, Guardian. Eldoria’s fate is now in your hands. Use it wisely. Balance is not a gift—it is a burden.”

You bow low, accepting the crystal. It warms in your grasp, as if recognizing your heart.

As you descend the Ironhowl Mountains, dawn breaks across the horizon. The storm clouds over Eldoria begin to lift, ever so slightly. You don’t know what trials lie ahead. But for now, hope flickers once again—and the kingdom breathes.

The Crystal of Aether has been found. The story begins anew.
