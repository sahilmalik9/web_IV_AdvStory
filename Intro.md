# The Crystal of Aether

The kingdom of Eldoria has been plunged into darkness. Whispers of a stolen crystal—the Crystal of Aether—spread across villages like wildfire. This ancient gem held the power to balance the elements, and without it, chaos begins to tear through the land.

You are Alex, a young scout from the edge of the Wyrmwood Forest. One evening, while returning from a supply run, a falcon delivers a scroll sealed with the royal crest. The message reads:

> "You have been chosen. The crystal must be recovered, or Eldoria will fall."

Guided by starlight and duty, you pack your gear and set off at dawn. Three days later, you arrive at the ancient crossroads deep in the forest. The path ahead splits in two:

- The left trail winds through the Mistfen Marsh, rumored to be cursed and filled with illusions.
- The right trail leads into the Ironhowl Mountains, home to old ruins and creatures of stone.

You take a breath and step forward.

**But which path will you choose?**
